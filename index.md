# Toure A. Karim Project Index
{: .no_toc .fs-9 }

TAK Project Index (TAK PI) is just a simple hub for some of <a href="https://github.com/trabdlkarim" target="_blank">@trabdlkarim</a> most important software development projects. You can think of it as a personal development lab  with various projects that you could customize for your own use upon downloading.

## Welcome 
{: .fs-7}

Welcome to the TAK PI, a collection of projects and references to help you download and share software packages. TAK Project Index is a core set of various types of personal software projects.

Just the Docs is built for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator. View the [quick start guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) for more information. Just the Docs requires no special plugins and can run on GitHub Pages' standard Jekyll compiler. The [Jekyll SEO Tag plugin](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag) is included by default (no need to run any special installation) to inject SEO and open graph metadata on docs pages. For information on how to configure SEO and open graph metadata visit the [Jekyll SEO Tag usage guide](https://jekyll.github.io/jekyll-seo-tag/usage/).

### Deployment


Packages exist to be installed (or deployed), so before you package anything, youâ€™ll want to have some answers to the deployment questions below:

- Who are your softwareâ€™s users? Will your software be installed by other developers doing software development, operations people in a datacenter, or a less software-savvy group?

- Is your software intended to run on servers, desktops, mobile clients (phones, tablets, etc.), or embedded in dedicated devices?

- Is your software installed individually, or in large deployment batches?

Packaging is all about target environment and deployment experience. There are many answers to the questions above and each combination of circumstances has its own solutions. With this information, the following overview will guide you to the packaging technologies best suited to your project.

### Source Code


TAK PI projects source code consists of multiple files, itâ€™s usually organized into a directory structure. 

Because packages consist of multiple files, they are harder to distribute. Most protocols support transferring only one file at a time (when was the last time you clicked a link and it downloaded multiple files?). Itâ€™s easier to get incomplete transfers, and harder to guarantee code integrity at the destination.

So long as your code contains nothing but pure Python code, and you know your deployment environment supports your version of Python, then you can use Pythonâ€™s native packaging tools to create a source Distribution Package, or sdist for short.

Pythonâ€™s sdists are compressed archives (.tar.gz files) containing one or more packages or modules. If your code is pure-Python, and you only depend on other Python packages, you can go here to learn more.

If you rely on any non-Python code, or non-Python packages (such as libxml2 in the case of lxml, or BLAS libraries in the case of numpy), you will need to use the format detailed in the next section, which also has many advantages for pure-Python libraries.

### Binaries


So much of Pythonâ€™s practical power comes from its ability to integrate with the software ecosystem, in particular libraries written in C, C++, Fortran, Rust, and other languages.

Not all developers have the right tools or experiences to build these components written in these compiled languages, so Python created the Wheel, a package format designed to ship libraries with compiled artifacts. In fact, Pythonâ€™s package installer, pip, always prefers wheels because installation is always faster, so even pure-Python packages work better with wheels.

Binary distributions are best when they come with source distributions to match. Even if you donâ€™t upload wheels of your code for every operating system, by uploading the sdist, youâ€™re enabling users of other platforms to still build it for themselves. Default to publishing both sdist and wheel archives together, unless youâ€™re creating artifacts for a very specific use case where you know the recipient only needs one or the other.

Python and PyPI make it easy to upload both wheels and sdists together. Just follow the Packaging Python Projects tutorial.

### Dependencies

Some types of Python applications, like web site backends and other network services, are common enough that they have frameworks to enable their development and packaging. Other types of applications, like dynamic web frontends and mobile clients, are complex enough to target that a framework becomes more than a convenience.

In all these cases, it makes sense to work backwards, from the frameworkâ€™s packaging and deployment story. Some frameworks include a deployment system which wraps the technologies outlined in the rest of the guide. In these cases, youâ€™ll want to defer to your frameworkâ€™s packaging guide for the easiest and most reliable production experience.

If you ever wonder how these platforms and frameworks work under the hood, you can always read the sections beyond.

As a general-purpose programming language, Python is designed to be used in many ways. You can build web sites or industrial robots or a game for your friends to play, and much more, all using the same core technology.

Pythonâ€™s flexibility is why the first step in every Python project must be to think about the projectâ€™s audience and the corresponding environment where the project will run. It might seem strange to think about packaging before writing code, but this process does wonders for avoiding future headaches.

## New Releases
{: .fs-7}

The Python Packaging Authority (PyPA) is a working group that maintains a core set of software projects used in Python packaging.

The software developed through the PyPA is used to package, share, and install Python software and to interact with indexes of downloadable Python software such as PyPI, the Python Package Index. Click the logo below to download pip, the most prominent software used to interact with PyPI.

## Code Snippets
{: .fs-7}

Snippet is a programming term for a small region of re-usable source code, machine code, or text. Ordinarily, these are formally defined operative units to incorporate into larger programming modules. That is why TAK PI doesn't only indexes some important projects, but also it is a pool of code snippets from GitHub gists. They allow you to avoid repetitive typing in the course of routine edit operations.
