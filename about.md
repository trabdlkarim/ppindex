<p class="message">
  Hey there! I'm TOURE Abdoul Karim, a Computer Engineering Student &  Freelance Developer. This site is a personal project pages stack or simply an index of personal projects that lists some of my most important open source and personal projects. Feel free to browse the pages, and use the projects for your own use upon downloading. Carry on!
</p>

In this index of projects, many of the projects are generally coursework projects, and  you will find that every listed project in the index has its code sources in a related github repository. And also every project has a dedicated page or site which gives more information about the project. So in order to find out more about the project, you might visit its related page or if you want to get the code, visit the related github repository. 

There are currently more projects on my github than those listed in this index, so to see a full list of the projects visit these pages:

* [GitHub Repositories](https://github.com/trabdlkarim?tab=repositories)
* [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/trabdlkarim)

Learn more and contribute on [my blog](https://www.trabdlkarim.com).
