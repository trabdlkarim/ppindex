## How Can I Contribute?

### Did you find a bug?
{: .mb-5}

- Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability, and instead send us [a security feedback]({% link issues/feedback.md %}).

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

- If possible, use the relevant [bug report template]({% link issues/templates.md %}#bug-report-template) to create the issue. Simply copy the content of the appropriate template, make the necessary changes to demonstrate the issue, and paste the content into the issue description.

- For more detailed information on submitting a bug report and creating an issue, visit our [bug reporting guidelines]({% link issues/bug-report.md %}#reporting-bugs-in-github).

### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

- Ensure the **Pull Request** description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

- Before submitting, please read the [source code styleguides]({% link resources/styleguides/index.md %}) to know more about coding conventions and benchmarks.


### Suggesting Enhancements
{: .mb-5}

**Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

- Suggest your change by sending us [an enhancement suggestion feedback]({% link issues/feedback.md %}) using [this feature suggestion template]({% link issues/templates.md %}#feature-suggestion-template) and start writing code.

- Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

- For more detailed information on submitting a feature suggestion about a project, visit our [enhancement suggestion guidelines]({% link issues/bug-report.md %}#suggesting-enhancements).
