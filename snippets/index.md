# Code Snippets

Excellent tools that allow  to avoid repetitive typing in the course of routine edit operations
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

Snippet is a programming term for a small region of re-usable source code, machine code, or text. Ordinarily, these are formally defined operative units to incorporate into larger programming modules. It is an excellent tool and  allows the user to avoid repetitive typing in the course of routine edit operations.

Rather than building a project from scratch, here are the collections of TAK PI snippets for coding challenges to improve your skills. If you want to get better at solving discrete problems, or improving your chops with a new programming language, these are all good options.
