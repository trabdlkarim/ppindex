# Project Euler Problems Solutions
{: .no_toc}

Project Euler (named after Leonhard Euler) is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. The project attracts adults and students interested in mathematics and computer programming. Since its creation in 2001 by Colin Hughes, Project Euler has gained notability and popularity worldwide. It includes over 600 problems, with a new one added once every two weeks. Problems are of varying difficulty but each is solvable in less than a minute of CPU time using an efficient algorithm on a modestly powered computer.

The following snippets constitute a solution pool, among others, for the [Project Euler Problems](https://projecteuler.net/archives){:target="_blank"}. 
In other terms, it's a set of Project Euler computational solutions written in Python, which is really useful for learning the language.
