## Reporting bugs in GitHub

TAK PI projects are generally hosted in GitHub. The original goal of GitHub was to help developers collaborate on code, but as the services grew, they added more features and become a project management tool for building software. GitHub has an issue tracker built in, which makes it easy for developers to keep track of bugs. We also use it to keep track of bugs. So if you would like to report a bug with a project just find its GitHub repository and open an issue there. We will then as soon as possible try to address the bug being reported.
