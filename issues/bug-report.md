## Reporting bugs in GitHub

TAK PI projects are generally hosted in GitHub. The original goal of GitHub was to help developers collaborate on code, but as the services grew, they added more features and become a project management tool for building software. GitHub has an issue tracker built in, which makes it easy for developers to keep track of bugs. We also use it to keep track of bugs. So if you would like to report a bug with a project just find its GitHub repository and open an issue there. We will then as soon as possible try to address the bug being reported.

## Bug report template

As you can imagine, filling out a bug report can take a while. Fortunately, you can speed up that process dramatically by using bug report template for GitHub.  All the important technical information (e.g. browser version, operating system, etc.) should be included in your GitHub issue - without you having to do any extra work.

You can even use the built-in bug report template of the concerned project repository before creating your issue and fill out the steps to reproduce the bug, as well as the expected and actual results.

## Suggest a feature

The feature suggestion works just like the bug reporting. The only difference is that you need to [send a direct feedback]({% link issues/feedback.md %}) describing the feature you want us to add. Or another easy way is, if you are a developer, you can [contribute]({% link projects/contributing.md %}) to the concerned project by forking, then adding a new branch for your feature and submit a pull request.
