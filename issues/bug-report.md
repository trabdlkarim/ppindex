## Reporting bugs in GitHub

TAK PI projects are generally hosted in GitHub. GitHub has an issue tracker built in, which makes it easy for developers to keep track of bugs. We use it to keep track of bugs. So if you would like to report a bug with a project just find its GitHub repository and open an issue there.

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for TAK Projects. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#submit-a-good-bug-report). Fill out [the required template](#), the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.


### Before Submitting A Bug
{: .mb-5}

> - Check the debugging guide of the project. You might be able to find the cause of the problem and fix things yourself. 

> - Check the [FAQs]({% link resources/faqs.md %}) on the list of common questions and problems.

> -  Determine which repository the problem should be reported in.

> - Perform a search to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

### Submit A Good Bug Report
{: .mb-5}

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/){:target="_blank"}. After you've determined which repository your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information by filling in [the template](#).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

> - **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.

> - Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started Atom, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal, or how you started Atom otherwise. When listing steps, don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut or an Atom command, and if so which one?

> - Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use Markdown code blocks.

> - Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.

> - Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.

> - Include screenshots and animated GIFs which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. If you use the keyboard while following the steps, record the GIF with the Keybinding Resolver shown. You can use this tool to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and this tool or this tool on Linux.

> - If you're reporting that Atom crashed, include a crash report with a stack trace from the operating system. On macOS, the crash report will be available in Console.app under "Diagnostic and usage information" > "User diagnostic reports". Include the crash report in the issue in a code block, a file attachment, or put it in a gist and provide link to that gist.

> - If the problem is related to performance or memory, include a CPU profile capture with your report.

> - If Chrome's developer tools pane is shown without you triggering it, that normally means that you have a syntax error in one of your themes or in your styles.less. Try running in Safe Mode and using a different theme or comment out the contents of your styles.less to see if that fixes the problem.
If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

## Suggesting Enhancements

The feature suggestion works just like the bug reporting. The only difference is that you need to [send a direct feedback]({% link issues/feedback.md %}) describing the feature you want us to add. Or another easy way is, if you are a developer, you can [contribute]({% link resources/contributing.md %}) to the concerned project by forking, then adding a new branch for your feature and submit a pull request.
