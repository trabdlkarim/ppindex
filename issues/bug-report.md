## Reporting bugs in GitHub

TAK PI projects are generally hosted in GitHub. GitHub has an issue tracker built in, which makes it easy for developers to keep track of bugs. We use it to keep track of bugs. So if you would like to report a bug with a project just find its GitHub repository and open an issue there.

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for TAK Projects. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#submit-a-good-bug-report). Fill out [the required template]({% link issues/templates.md %}#bug-report-template), the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.


### Before Submitting A Bug
{: .mb-5}

- Check the debugging guide of the project. You might be able to find the cause of the problem and fix things yourself. 
- Check the [FAQs]({% link resources/faqs.md %}) on the list of common questions and problems.
- Determine which repository the problem should be reported in.
- Perform a search to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

### Submit A Good Bug Report
{: .mb-5}

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/){:target="_blank"}. After you've determined which repository your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information by filling in [the template]({% link issues/templates.md %}#bug-report-template).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

> - **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.

> - **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started a program, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal, or how you started it otherwise. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut or an other commands, and if so which one?

> - **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github){:target="_blank"}.

> - **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.

> - **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why**.

> - **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. If you use the keyboard while following the steps, you can use [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [Silentcast](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) on Linux.

> - **If you're reporting a crash**, include a crash report with a stack trace from the operating system. On macOS, the crash report will be available in Console.app under "Diagnostic and usage information" > "User diagnostic reports". Include the crash report in the issue in a code block, a file attachment, or put it in a gist and provide link to that gist.

> - **If the problem is related to performance or memory**, include a CPU profile capture with your report.


> - **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.
