## Reporting bugs in GitHub

TAK PI projects are generally hosted in GitHub. GitHub has an issue tracker built in, which makes it easy for developers to keep track of bugs. We use it to keep track of bugs. So if you would like to report a bug with a project just find its GitHub repository and open an issue there.

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for TAK Projects. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#submit-a-good-bug-report). Fill out [the required template](#), the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.


### Before Submitting A Bug
{: .mb-5}

> - Check the debugging guide of the project. You might be able to find the cause of the problem and fix things yourself. 

> - Check the [FAQs]({% link resources/faqs.md %}) on the list of common questions and problems.

> -  Determine which repository the problem should be reported in.

> - Perform a search to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

### Submit A Good Bug Report
{: .mb-5}

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/){:target="_blank"}. After you've determined which repository your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information by filling in [the template](#).

## Bug report template

As you can imagine, filling out a bug report can take a while. Fortunately, you can speed up that process dramatically by using bug report template for GitHub.  All the important technical information (e.g. browser version, operating system, etc.) should be included in your GitHub issue - without you having to do any extra work.

You can even use the built-in bug report template of the concerned project repository before creating your issue and fill out the steps to reproduce the bug, as well as the expected and actual results.

## Suggest a feature

The feature suggestion works just like the bug reporting. The only difference is that you need to [send a direct feedback]({% link issues/feedback.md %}) describing the feature you want us to add. Or another easy way is, if you are a developer, you can [contribute]({% link resources/contributing.md %}) to the concerned project by forking, then adding a new branch for your feature and submit a pull request.
