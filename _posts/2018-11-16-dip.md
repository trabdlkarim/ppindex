title: Digital Image Processing (DIP)
---
This project is a digital image processing coursework project. Ä°t will basically introduces you to image processing fundamentals with tools like jupyter notebook, python matplolib and numpy modules. Many of the concepts such as image sampling and quantization, intensity transformation, image histogram processing, spatial filtering, image restoration and reconstraction, morphological image processing, etc. derive from a textbook entitled "Digital Image Processing", written by [Rafael C. Gonzalez](http://imageprocessingplace.com/root_files_V3/about_the_authors/gonzalez.htm) and [Richard E. Woods.](http://www.rwood.ca/richard-wood-biography).
The project could also be seen as an image processing tutorial for beginners, and at the same as a code pool...
