This is an Algorithmic Analysis coursework project. It will basically introduces you to analysis of algorithms fundamentals. Many of the concepts such as best-case and worst-case analysis, big-o natation, abstract data types, etc. The project could also be seen as an algorithmic analysis tutorial for beginners, and at the same as a code poolâ€¦
